## Introduction

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping of transactions. This project extends the basic blockchain concept by incorporating features like asymmetric encryption for secure transactions, Merkle tree for efficient data verification, and a structure consisting of blocks.

## Features

- Asymmetric encryption for secure transactions
- Block structure with transactions
- Merkle tree implementation for efficient data verification
- Basic blockchain functionalities

Implementation Details
Asymmetric Encryption
The project uses asymmetric encryption to secure transactions. Public and private key pairs are generated for each participant, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Blockchain
The blockchain is implemented as a chain of blocks, with each block containing a list of transactions. Blocks are linked through their hashes, creating a secure and tamper-resistant ledger.

Transactions
Transactions represent the transfer of assets between participants. They are securely signed using participants' private keys to ensure authenticity.

Blocks
Blocks contain a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block's hash. The hash of each block is calculated based on its content, providing data integrity.

Merkle Tree
The Merkle tree is employed for efficient data verification. It helps verify the consistency of transaction data without needing to traverse the entire blockchain.
